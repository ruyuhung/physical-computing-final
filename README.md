### A study on infinity mirror

#### Name: Ruby Hung
#### Date: 12.03.2017

## Introduction:
In this project, I will explore the affordance of [Sparkfun Sound Detector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12642) and its embodiment onto an "[Infinity Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_mirror),"  hologram, and servo motor. Internet of Things and to be more specific, '[Particle.io](https://www.particle.io/)' and Redboard's wifi connection, grant us the abilities to grab data from our environment and make transformation of these numbers.  
To explore multiple ways of converting analog audio input to various facets of output, I choose different objects from the LED strips to a generative holography by JavaScript, and the kinetic energy of a motor. The reason that I select infinity mirror as the stage not only because its dramatic and aesthetic visual representation, but also the looping concept which resonates with the programming world and the potential which technology evolves,  transforms and reinvents itself. My project is positioned between the subjects of computing, visual programming, computer-based (or handmade)  artifacts, and the imagination of future space. The primary practice would be process documenting  and critical analysis.

This is the html reading the sound value and producing circle graph accordingly. At this moment, they are constructed from random values. (http://people.duke.edu/~jh518/Sound/sound.html)

## Conceptual Description:

### Soundscape:
Soundscape is the environmental audio that could be perceived by humans. It is not bounded to only one specific type of sound source but also others, such as, natural and human generated audio. The term was first used in 1969 from Michael Southworth in his article 'The Sonic Environment of Cities.' And it gradually becomes a common terminology in the realm of audio and immersive environment. Soundscape is adopted here to denote the relationships between our audio environment and the effects generated by sound.

### Infinity Mirror:
Infinity mirror is my primary display in this project. The major structure of infinity mirror can be divided into a diagram in the following.  It consists of two layers of mirrors. In the front is a piece of 'two-way mirror' and at the back is the normal mirror. If we put anything in between, we will see two mirrors interacting with each other and the two-way mirror allow the audience to see through it. In general, it is a phenomenon of endless reflection between two pieces of mirrors.

### Holography
The choice of holography is the imagination of future urban landscape. As several sci-fi movies have shown, in the future, the urban landscape would still have dense and concrete buildings but with intangible but visible hologram, for instance, in 'Blade Runner 2049,' future cities are depicted as giant holographic figures in the streets that could interact with humans.
Holography means the process of making hologram which allows the audience to watch three-dimensional images without putting any other devices on them, such  as, lens or other form of glasses. Here in my project, a simplified version of hologram made by acrylic sheet will be presented, and the content will be sound generated graph by p5*JS.

### Critical Making Practice:
[To Be Continued]

## Material & Software Used
	• Electronic Components:
		○ Particle RedBoard
		○ Sound detector
		○ LED strip (WS2812)
		○ Servo motor ()
		○ Screen Display for hologram (iPad)
	• Enclosure Components:
		○ 3D printed frame
	• Infinity Mirror Material:
		○ 12 * 12 inch acrylic mirror
		○ 12 * 12 two way mirror sheet
		○ 12 * 12 acrylic board (1/8")
	• Software and Hardware:
		○ Fusion 360
		○ Adobe Illustrator
		○ P5*Js
		○ Particle IDE
		○ Fusion Laser Cutter
		○ Ultimaker 2 (3D printer)

## Proposed Form
It will be a cube  of 7" * 7" * 7" with three sides of mirrors. The front mirror will be the illusion mirror. In the middle of the stage,  by putting a hologram (made by acrylics) that shows the visualization of the  sound. In addition a servo motor in the middle would respond to the sound as well.

*** the size is determined by the printer bed of Ultimaker2 which co-lab has, and it is 8" * 8" * 8"

## Technical Practice:

### Sound Detector Test (click to watch the link)

### Prototype of the Prototype (click to watch the link)

Before using the LED strip (WS2812), I soldered the individual led together and build a simple stand from the rest of my material.

### Particle cloud
#### particle variable
```C++
#define PIN_ANALOG_IN A0

Particle.variable("soundValue", &val, INT);

int readSound()
{
    val = analogRead(PIN_ANALOG_IN);
    return val;
}
```

### P5*JS programming
In order to use the analog data input from Particle IDE, in P5*JS libraries, I use loadJSON function to call the data from the particle cloud
```JavaScript
var url ='https:/api.particle.io/v1/devices/320039001751353432393433/soundValue?access_token=394d3c6278fbfca17465503aeaeea4c05fc2eb1f';
data = loadJSON(url, parseData);
```
And generate four identical circles for the hologram and also set the ellipse diameter as the reading data from the sound detector, also use map() function to map the sound value to the size of my canvas.
```JavaScript
function parseData(data)
{
  reading = data.result;
	 // the statement after data has to be the names in JSON!!!
  radius = map(reading, 0, 4046, 1, 500);
	// map the audio envelope input to the size of 1/4*canvas
}
```

### Laser Cutting:
For precise cutting of mirrors and acrylics, I use the "Epilog Fusion M2 Laser" Cutter to cut 7 * 7 inch mirror and acrylic hologram with adobe illustrator.

### 3D Design
For the frames of infinity mirror, I used Autodesk Fusion 360 and print them out by 'ultimaker2' provided by Co-Lab at Duke.
