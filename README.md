# Project: MultifacetedSoundScape
## A study on infinity mirror

## Introduction:
In this project, I explore the affordance of [Sparkfun Sound Detector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12642) and its embodiment onto an "[Infinity Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_mirror),"  hologram, and servo motor. To explore multiple ways of converting the analog audio input to various facets of output, I choose different objects from the LED strips to a generative holography by JavaScript and the kinetic energy of a servo motor. The reason that I select infinity mirror as the stage not only because of its dramatic and aesthetic visual representation but also the looping concept which resonates with the programming world and the potential which technology evolves,  transforms and reinvents itself. My project is positioned between the subjects of computing, visual programming, computer-based (or handmade)  artifacts, and the imagination of future space. The primary practice would be to process documenting and critical making analysis.

## Concept Description:

### Physical Form
It will be a cube  of 7" * 7" * 7" with three sides of mirrors. The front mirror will be the infinity mirror. In additions, a servo motor placed in the middle would respond to the sound as well. Next to the stage, by putting a hologram (made by acrylics) that shows the visualization of the sound. The size is determined by the printer bed of Ultimaker2 which co-lab has, and it is 8" * 8" * 8"

### Input and output
The following diagram shows the input and output devices in this project. (1)

### Soundscape:
Soundscape is the environmental audio that could be perceived by humans. It is not bounded to only one specific type of sound source but also others, such as, natural and human generated audio. The term was first used in 1969 from Michael Southworth in his article 'The Sonic Environment of Cities.'  [(2)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001391656900100104) And it gradually becomes a common terminology in the realm of audio and immersive environment. Soundscape is adopted here to denote the relationships between our audio environment and the effects generated by sound.

### Infinity Mirror:
Infinity mirror is my primary display in this project. The major structure of infinity mirror can be divided into a diagram in the following.  It consists of two layers of mirrors. In the front is a piece of 'two-way mirror' and at the back is the normal mirror. If we put anything in between, we will see two mirrors interacting with each other and the two-way mirror allow the audience to see through it. In general, it is a phenomenon of endless reflection between two pieces of mirrors. (1)

### Holography
The choice of holography is the imagination of future urban landscape. As several sci-fi movies have shown, in the future, the urban landscape would still have dense and concrete buildings but with intangible but visible hologram, for instance, in 'Blade Runner 2049,' future cities are depicted as giant holographic figures in the streets that could interact with humans.
Holography means the process of making hologram which allows the audience to watch three-dimensional images without putting any other devices on them, such  as, lens or other form of glasses. Here in my project, a simplified version of hologram made by acrylic sheet will be presented, and the content will be sound generated graph by p5*JS.

### Prototype of the Prototype (click to watch the link)
Before using the LED strip (WS2812), I soldered the individual led together and build a simple stand from the rest of my material.

### Particle cloud
#### particle variable
```C++
#define PIN_ANALOG_IN A0

Particle.variable("soundValue", &val, INT);

int readSound()
{
    val = analogRead(PIN_ANALOG_IN);
    return val;
}
```

### P5*JS programming
In order to use the analog data input from Particle IDE, in P5*JS libraries, I use loadJSON function to call the data from the particle cloud
```JavaScript
var url ='https:/api.particle.io/v1/devices/320039001751353432393433/soundValue?access_token=394d3c6278fbfca17465503aeaeea4c05fc2eb1f';
data = loadJSON(url, parseData);
```
And generate four identical circles for the hologram and also set the ellipse diameter as the reading data from the sound detector, also use map() function to map the sound value to the size of my canvas.
```JavaScript
function parseData(data)
{
  reading = data.result;
	 // the statement after data has to be the names in JSON!!!
  radius = map(reading, 0, 4046, 1, 500);
	// map the audio envelope input to the size of 1/4*canvas
}
```

This is the html reading the sound value and producing circle graph accordingly.

When it is not reading the sound input, this is another similar webpage constructing by random value.

### Laser Cutting:
For precise cutting of mirrors and acrylics, I use the "Epilog Fusion M2 Laser" Cutter to cut 7 * 7 inch mirror and acrylic hologram with adobe illustrator.

### 3D Design
For the frames of infinity mirror, I used Autodesk Fusion 360 and print them out by 'ultimaker2' provided by Co-Lab at Duke.

## Conclusion:

### Evaluation:
In this project, the primary purpose is to combine all the tools we've learned in class. It is a good combination of tools, from basic redboard controls to particle variables and loadJSON, from  soldering, laser cutting, to 3D modeling. For the general concept of my project, it is easy for the audience to perceive, for example, the audio input and various outputs. Aesthetically, the printed model, I used dark blue spray paint to make the background consistent with a darker color. The neopixel strips and the led stands could stand out of the context.  In the limited time scope, the consistent visual of my project is one of the pros.
On the other hand, the direct sound output might need more varieties instead of blinking the LED or. The originality part might have room for improvement; however,  as a prototype, this two positions helped me understand the basic structure of this art representation. Personally, it could be a high start point for future creativity.

### Reflection:
During the process, the shift of making process is the first thing that occurs to me. Before, it is hard to imagine the possibility of making the frames of mirrors and even putting a responding light into it without a well-equipped carpenter house and maybe some designing background. The difference between regular tutorials on 'How to make an illusion mirror?' and my approach is distinct. Firstly, in most of the previous cases, the frames are made out of wood, and the entire process is primarily in a cutting logic. On the contrast, with the help of 3D printers, the overall experience is "Building," the digital technology which allowed me to transform the cutting process from real life into the computer-aided modeling (CAD) software. Often, you will need a lot of carpenter tools, such as a hand saw, claw hammer, chisel, nail gun, wood bench, and sawhorse.  
Another crucial question appears along the way as well. Am I a critical maker or just a technology consumer? Not a seasoned 3d modeler nor a trained designer, but the basic understanding of solid modeling workflow allows me to taste the fruit of really designing something.

In the future,  I am interested in applying rasberryPi and API to my project. Also, I hope to explore more of the neopixel control and do more research on the light control and reaction. For now, the blinking effect seems to be predictable. In additions, it would be great to learn more about the potential of generative javascript graph.
